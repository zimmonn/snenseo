# Snenseo 
Snenseo is a zepyhr based firmware that implements a BLE device and is able to interact with a [Senseo coffe machine](https://www.senseo.us/about-senseo/the-senseo-coffee-pod-system/).

 Modifications for the coffee machine are required and severe mistakes might also break the 40 € machine.
